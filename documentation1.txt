### AI-Based Data Analysis and Business Insight Generation Process

---

### Overview
This process automates generating business insights and visualizations from a dataset using AI agents. It involves three agents:

1. **SQL Agent (Data Preparation Agent)**
2. **Insight Generation Agent (AI Insight Agent)**
3. **Visualization Agent (AI Visualization Agent)**

Each agent transforms raw data into actionable insights and visualizations.

---

### Components

1. **SQL Agent**: Processes and prepares data by executing SQL queries.
2. **Insight Generation Agent**: Analyzes the prepared data and generates business insights.
3. **Visualization Agent**: Creates visualizations (charts/graphs) based on insights.

---

## 1. **SQL Agent (Data Preparation)**

### Purpose
This agent prepares the data by running SQL queries. It extracts and processes raw data into a structured dataset for analysis.

### Workflow
1. **Extract data** from database tables.
2. **Transform data** using SQL queries (joins, filters, aggregations).
3. **Output**: Structured dataset in a format like `DataFrame`.

---

## 2. **Insight Generation Agent (AI Insight Agent)**

### Purpose
This agent generates business insights based on the dataset. It uses an AI model (e.g., **GPT-3** or **Llama-3.3**) to answer business questions.

### Workflow
1. **Input**: Clean dataset (output from SQL Agent).
2. **Generate dynamic questions** based on the dataset schema.
3. **Answer business questions**: Derives actionable insights from the data.
4. **Output**: Question-answer pairs with insights.

---

## 3. **Visualization Agent (AI Visualization Agent)**

### Purpose
This agent creates high-quality visualizations (e.g., charts and graphs) to display the insights generated in the previous step.

### Workflow
1. **Input**: Clean dataset and insights.
2. **Generate visualizations**: Creates bar charts, time-series plots, etc., to represent data.
3. **Output**: High-quality visualizations like graphs and charts.

## Example Process

### Step 1: SQL Agent
```python
# SQL Agent generates the following query:
sql_query = """
    SELECT p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_sales
    FROM Products p
    JOIN Order_Items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
"""
# Output: Clean dataset (DataFrame)
output_df = execute_sql_on_dataframe(sql_query, table_dict)
```

### Step 2: Insight Generation Agent
```python
# Insight Agent answers business questions:
insight_agent = InsightAgent(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
questions = ["What are the top-selling products?", "Which product has the highest sales volume?"]
insights = insight_agent.run(output_df, questions)

# Example output:
{
    "What are the top-selling products?": "Product A has $500,000 in sales.",
    "Which product has the highest sales volume?": "Product B has sold 10,000 units."
}
```

### Step 3: Visualization Agent
```python
# Visualization Agent generates a bar chart:
visualization_agent = VisualizationAgent()
visualization_agent.generate_bar_chart(output_df, x="product_name", y="total_sales", title="Sales by Product")
```

---

### Final Output
- **SQL Agent**: Cleans and prepares the data.
- **Insight Agent**: Generates clear business insights based on questions.
- **Visualization Agent**: Creates high-quality visualizations to represent insights.

### Key Features:
1. **Automation**: Automates the entire process, reducing manual work.
2. **Actionable Insights**: Provides insights directly usable for decision-making.
3. **High-Quality Visualizations**: Enables better understanding of data trends.
4. **Dynamic Questions**: Generates relevant business questions based on the data.

---

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Custom Visualizations**: Users can specify preferred chart types.
2. **Interactive Dashboards**: Allow users to explore data interactively.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Integrate machine learning for forecasting.
4. **Role-based Insights**: Tailor insights to different business roles (e.g., marketing, sales).

This framework enables businesses to automatically process data, gain insights, and visualize them in a way that supports quick, data-driven decisions.
